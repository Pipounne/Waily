# Proposal :

Our project would be software that the user would launch at the start of a battle in the game waven. The software would aim to see and understand the placement of enemies as well as their types and statistics. He must also be able to read and know the cards he has available to play. His mission will then be to play against the enemies. To play he will have to perform two actions, move/attack (in waven the attack is an extension of the movement) as well as cast cards (spells) to overcome enemies. In addition, he must respect the rules imposed by the game to succeed in the daily quest.
If we succeed in the project, there are two very similar ways to improve it. The first is to ensure that the software can launch itself into the game and that it can navigate the menus on its own to choose which fight to carry out. The second would be that he can repeat the same mission a defined number of times to collect rewards in large quantities.
It would also be interesting to teach our project to play with characters that have more complicated gameplay.
